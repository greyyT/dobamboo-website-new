            In 2004, fellow MIT graduate students Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah noticed a major shift in the way
            people shop and purchase products. Buyers didn’t want to be interrupted by ads, they wanted helpful
            information. In 2006, they founded HubSpot to help companies use that shift to grow better with inbound
            marketing.

            Along the way, HubSpot expanded beyond marketing into a crafted, not cobbled suite of products that create
            the frictionless customer experience that buyers expect today. Expertly led by CEO Yamini Rangan, HubSpot
            uses its customer platform built on an AI-powered Smart CRM to help millions of scaling organizations grow
            better.
